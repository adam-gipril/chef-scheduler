# Chef Cal Integration

> My friends and I cook dinner almost every night. One of us cooks a main dish, and someone else
> cooks a side.
>
> â€” <cite>Zana Jipsen</cite>

Zana very kindly developed a Python application called
[Chef Scheduler](https://github.com/zjipsen/chef-scheduler) for scheduling each of us to cook on
days we're available, and with an extra degree of intelligence in favoring chefs who haven't cooked
in a while. The Python application sends out schedule updates once weekly via text message.

Because text conversations can be easily buried and difficult to resurface, it would be convenient
to also glance at the schedule in a Calendar view. Additionally, calendar integration means the
built-in notification support already in place on most calendars can be leveraged for more easily-
and personally-configured push notifications when it's your time to cook.

This Node/Express application accepts POST requests from the scheduler, and converts the schedule
into Google Calendar events.

## API

### Endpoint: `/schedule`

| schedule   | array of `ScheduleData` objects        | Required          | Cooking event information                          |

where a `ScheduleData` object consists of

| Field | Type   | Required/Optional | Description                                   | Allowed Values                    |

| day   | string | Required          | Day of the week on which cooking event occurs | `SUN`, `MON`, `TUE`, `WED`, `THU` |

### Example

```json
{
  "start-date": "2019-09-29",
  "schedule": [
    {
      "type": "main",
      "chef": "Zana",
      "day": "SUN"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Developing

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (12.4.x)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)

### Cloning the project and installing dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bikeshaman/chef-cal-integration.git
cd chef-cal-integration
nvm install
npm install
```

### Compiling

This project is written in TypeScript, and therefore needs to be compiled before it can be run by
Node.js. To compile the project, run:

```bash
npm run build       # compiles the project
npm run build:watch # compiles the project and watches for changes
```

### Running the server

The server can be started using one of the following commands. Port 4003 is default, and can be
overridden by preceding either command with `PORT=<desired port>`.

```bash
npm start           # runs the server
npm run start:watch # runs the server using nodemon to watch for changes
```

Nodemon is configured to run node registered with `ts-node`, so changes to TypeScript files
will trigger a restart of the server.

### Debugging

There are several paths to success for debugging this project. Here are a few options which are
pre-configured:

#### Nodemon with Chrome DevTools

The `nodemon.json` configuration runs node in inspect mode. When Chrome detects a node process
running in inspect mode, an icon will appear in the top left corner of any open DevTools panel.
A click on that icon will open a new instance of DevTools, attached to the Node process:

<span style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">![DevTools](/assets/images/devtools.png)</span>

#### Nodemon launched with VSCode debugger

A VSCode debugger configuration named "Launch via NPM" is available. This configuration, when run,
executes `npm run start:watch` with the VSCode debugger attached to the process. Breakpoints and
Logpoints can be set in the left gutter of the VSCode editor. Read
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_debug-actions) for more information
on the VSCode debugger.

#### VSCode debugger attached to running Nodemon process, or running, built Node process

In addition to the "Launch via NPM" configuration, an "Attach by Process ID" configuration is
available. This allows the VSCode debugger to attach to an already-running instance of the server,
without the process needing to be in inspect mode. Simply run the server, run the debugger, and
select to which node process the debugger should attach.

### Authentication

This application is configured to work with Google service accounts having the
[Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar) enabled.

Requests to the API are authenticated using OAuth 2.0, with credentials loaded from the
`CREDENTIALS` environment variable. The environment variable needs to be set on your machine or the
deployment instance, and its value should be the stringified `credentials.json` object obtained
through the [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for your service
account.

For more information on OAuth 2.0, Google service accounts, and obtaining the requisite credentials
to make successful requests to Google, see
[Using OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount).

## Testing

Unit tests in this project are written using [Jest](https://jestjs.io). At the time of this writing,
the project has 100% test coverage. The following commands are available for running the tests.

```bash
npm test              # runs all tests
npm run test:watch    # runs all tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # outputs test coverage, opens report in a browser
```

Additional options can be passed to the test command, separated from npm options with `--`. Read
[here](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli#options) for more information.

I also recommend the Jest extension for VSCode, which runs all tests in watch mode for you, with
feedback on test status visualized directly in your IDE.

## Documentation

Each method, class, and interface definition is documented using [JSDoc](https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/)
syntax. Many IDEs are capable of generating hover-over documentation on-the-fly from JSDoc syntax.

To compile a navigable documentation resource and open it in your default browser, be sure to first
[compile the project](#compiling) then run:

```bash
npm run docs
```

## Deploying

This application is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). A webhook is in place to
automatically update the deployment any time a change is committed to `master` on the GitHub repo.
Google credentials are set with a config var through the Heroku dashboard or CLI.

I'm currently the only individual with access to the deployment, so please get in touch with any
questions or requests regarding the deploy.

## Contributing

With the webhook in place to automatically deploy any committed changes to `master`, please
contribute via a feature branch and pull request. That being said, it's pretty low stakes if
something fails on this service, so no big deal.
